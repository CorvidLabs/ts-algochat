# TypeScript AlgoChat

## Purpose

Provides the TypeScript implementation of the AlgoChat encrypted-messaging protocol on Algorand. The package derives and exchanges encryption keys, encodes standard and pre-shared-key envelopes, submits and indexes note transactions, models conversations, and supplies durable queue, cache, and key-storage abstractions without concealing blockchain metadata.

## Invariants

1. Standard messages use a fresh ephemeral X25519 key and ChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption; decryption supports both recipient and sender key paths.
2. Binary decoders reject unsupported versions, protocols, truncated fields, malformed lengths, and unauthenticated ciphertext rather than returning partial content.
3. Key announcements are accepted only when their address, signing key, encryption key, and signature agree.
4. PSK mode combines ECDH material with a ratcheted PSK, derives a new position key per counter, and rejects replayed or unreasonably far-ahead counters.
5. A message transaction is a minimum-payment transfer whose note fits the Algorand 1,024-byte limit; oversize payloads fail before submission.
6. Indexed history is filtered to the participants, decoded defensively, de-duplicated, and returned in chronological order.
7. Queue transitions are explicit and retry counts are bounded; successful removal occurs only after delivery succeeds.
8. File-backed secrets and queue state use authenticated encryption or atomic replacement and never silently substitute corrupt persisted data.
9. Network clients remain injectable so protocol behavior can be verified without live Algorand mutation.
10. The package does not claim metadata privacy: account addresses, transaction timing, and on-chain activity remain observable.
11. Encryption keys are derived from 32-byte mnemonic entropy for every scheme. `createRandomChatAccount()` defaults to Falcon-1024 `pqsig`. `createChatAccountFromMnemonic` without a scheme recovers Ed25519. The same mnemonic yields identical X25519 keys and different addresses across schemes. Falcon payments use at least `minFee * FALCON_FEE_MULTIPLIER` (3).

## Behavioral Examples

```
Given a sender account, recipient encryption key, and plaintext
When AlgorandService sends a standard message
Then it encrypts an authenticated envelope, embeds it in a valid note transaction, submits it, and returns the transaction identifier
```

```
Given a PSK state that has already accepted a counter
When the same counter is received again
Then replay validation rejects it without advancing the receive state
```

```
Given queued messages and restored connectivity
When SyncManager starts synchronization
Then SendQueue processes eligible entries in order, records failures for retry, and removes only successful entries
```

## Error Cases

| Error | Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `EncryptionError` / `EnvelopeError` | Invalid key material, ciphertext, version, protocol, or binary layout | Reject encryption/decryption or decoding with a typed error |
| `PSKEncryptionError` / `PSKEnvelopeError` | Invalid PSK, counter, authentication tag, or PSK envelope | Reject without emitting plaintext or changing replay state |
| `SignatureError` | Wrong Ed25519/X25519 key size or invalid announcement signature | Reject key publication or discovery |
| `MessageTooLargeError` | Encoded note exceeds 1,024 bytes | Do not construct or submit the transaction |
| `PublicKeyNotFoundError` | No valid announcement is found within the configured search | Return an explicit discovery failure |
| Storage errors | Password absent, decryption fails, data is invalid, or key is missing | Preserve existing storage and report the distinct cause |
| `ChatError` | Public service or protocol operation fails | Preserve a stable `ChatErrorCode`, message, cause, and optional context |
